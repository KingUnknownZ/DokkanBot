# How to get Database and assets. 
---
You need a rooted phone, I prefer using [Nox emulator](https://www.bignox.com/) since you can easily transfer files between it and the PC.
1. Make sure that the game is updated and has all the data
2. Download a root explorer 
3. Go to `data/data/`

 `com.bandainamcogames.dbzdokkanww` for global

 `com.bandainamcogames.dbzdokkan` for Japanese

4. Open up `files`

 Go to `backup` for the database and then copy it to the main folder then decrypt it

 For the assets open up `assets` and copy the .cpks to the images folder and unpack them. Just look up "How to unpack cpks" on google.
